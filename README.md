Would You Rather Project

This is the Udacity's React second project. This project allows users to create a game.
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, the game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

##Installation 
The application requires yarn install/npm install start the development server with npm start
